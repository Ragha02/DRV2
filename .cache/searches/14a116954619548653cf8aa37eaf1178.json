This study aims to analyse the underlying epidemiological situation in India and explain possible impacts of policy and technological changes.\\nSecondary data were utilized, including recently published literature from government sources, the COVID-19 India website and local media reports. These data were analysed, with a focus on the impact of policy and technological interventions.\\nHowever, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases. This factor, coupled with low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), created mayhem because of inadequate numbers of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the damage resulting from the pandemic. Following nationwide lockdown, the Indian economy was hit hard by unemployment and a steep decline in growth.\\nNevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the health and economic damage resulting from the pandemic. In the future, measures such as asymptomatic testing, public–private partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine against COVID-19 can be developed and rolled-out in India.')]",
